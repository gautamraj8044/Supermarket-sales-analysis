**Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis**

**Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using Python programming and data visualization techniques. The dataset comprises over a thousand invoices, and the analysis aims to uncover insights into customer behavior, purchase preferences, and sales trends based on various factors such as location, gender, payment methods, and product categories.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas library
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Statistical analysis to identify sales trends and variations
- Interpretation of insights to drive informed decision-making in retail environments

**Files Included:**
